1. Simple packet counter to learn framework:
    - setup dir app_aelz,complile                                   /* done */
    - receive commands from CLI interface                           /* done */
    - count messages from pcap file                                 /* done */
    - repeat configuraiton from scratch and update README, INSTALL  /* done */
    - send for review to blockmon owners                            /* None due to minor changes */
    - git own repo, join to blockmon                                /* done */
    - codeblocks, git path

Definition of done (DoD):
    - README, INSTALL are available
    - own repo created (analog /usr/app_*).
    - own code compiled/ run together with blockmon

2. Icmp analyser:
    - receive commands from CLI interface
    - analyse messages from pcap file
    - analyse different icmp msg types in pcap mix

DoD: ?

3. Icmp advanced analyser:
    - should analyse message body for different icmp msg types in pcap mix ?
    - receive commands from python daemon via graphical interface (proto)
    - receive message from  existing eth0 / wlan0 / lo? interface
    - receive messages from custom created interface (loopback)

4. Analyse available open source modules:
    - analyse available OSM based on blockmon package
    - which one are mandatory in our current architecture / which one are
    - what kind of license for mandatory OSM ?

DoD:
    - List of OSM modules with comments where used (Just enough principle)
    - First draft of System Arhcitecture
